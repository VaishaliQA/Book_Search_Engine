# Book Search Engine

## Description:

This Google Books API search engine application was originally built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/ Express.js server and API. My challenge this week was to take this fully functioning search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
